# Splity
Split the bill with your friends! 
An easy way to calculate the amount per person, adding an optional tip to the waitress.

# What did I learn with this project?
This project was a challenge proposed by Paul Hudson on his program "Hacking With Swift".
I could understand more about SwiftUI elements such as Forms; Sections; Text Input and Keyboard options. I also managed to learn about @State and @FocusState variables and their role on Views.

# How does it work?
The UI is very straightforward, following the typical iOS design.
The user must insert the amount to be split and by how many people.

As soon as the amount is inserted, Splity automatically displays the "total + tip" AND "amount per person". The user can change the tip percentage at any given time.
